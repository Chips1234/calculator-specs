<!-- Update with a concise title describing your feature. -->

### Feature Pitch Link
https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/806

### Problem Statement
This will create a new calculation mode, "Financial". It will be similar to the date calculator with a combobox at the top to choose modes (current modes are Tip and Compound Interest). Target audience: Anyone with financial assets to people going out for lunch.

### Evidence or User Insights
We should do this to offer more tools to calculator users and make this a more feature-packed calculator (GitHub issue: [#806](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/806))

### Proposal
Create a new feature "Financial". With it, we can target investors and even students learning about financial responsibility.

### Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
* Create a compound interest calculator
* Tips calculator

### Non-Goals
* Even more modes

### Success Criteria
Sucess can be mesured with users, and engagement time.

### Feature Requirements
* Users can input Base Rate, term, times compounded, and interest rate to get the future rate.
* Users can input the bill amout, tip percentage and if they want to split the bill (and if yes, between how many people) and recieve the result.
