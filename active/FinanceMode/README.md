## Financial Calculator

### Feature Pitch Link
https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/806

### Problem Statement
This will create a new calculation mode, "Financial". It will be similar to the date calculator with a combobox at the top to choose modes (current modes are Tip calculation and Compound Interest). Target audience: Anyone from financial investors to people going out for lunch.

### Evidence or User Insights
We should do this to offer more tools to calculator users and make this a more feature-packed calculator (GitHub issue: [#806](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/806))

### Proposal
Create a new feature "Financial". With it, we can target investors and even students learning about finance. As Windows Calculator from Windows 7 had a few worksheets to calculate mortgage, fuel economy, etc so it will be easier for people transitioning from Win7 to Win10:

### Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
* Create a compound interest calculator (Find future value and principle)
* Tips calculator
* Mortgage Calculator 

### Non-Goals
* Even more modes

### Success Criteria
Sucess can be mesured with users, and engagement time.

### Feature Requirements
* Users can input Principle, term (in day, month or year), times compounded (per year), and interest rate (percentage or decimal) to get the future rate.
> Formula: Future Value = Principle(1+(interest [in decimal]/frequency))^Years* Frequency [[1]](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Compound-Interest#:~:text=Part%202%20of%203%3A%20Calculating%20Compound%20Interest%20on,you%20are%20inputting%20them%20correctly.%20More%20items...%20).
* Users can input the bill amout, tip percentage and if they want to split the bill (and if yes, between how many people) and recieve the result.
> Fomula: Total = Amount Due * 1.Tip (percentage) [[2]](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/tip-calculator.php)

The result should be the same as long as the the values are equal (just in different, e.g. 365 days, 12 months, 1 year)

If one or more fields are not filled out, an error will show.

Here's how it will look when minimied to the smallest possible size.

### Tip page

Just like the compound interest calculator, if one or more fields are empty, it will display a warning.

### Appendix
Phases:
Look at devoloping more modes later on.

Risks and Open Issues:
Open issue: I think the everything is up for discussion. 
Risks: I don't think there are.
