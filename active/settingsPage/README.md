## Add Settings Page to Windows Calculator

Feature Pitch Link: https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/issues/596

### Problem Statement
Calculator currently does not have a settings page, which will block future work. The current about dialog is also inconsistent with many other Microsoft apps.

### Evidence or User Insights
Many suggested features have suggested adding options in settings (see feature pitch link for details). Without a Settings Page, we are blocked from moving forward with some of these features.

### Proposal
Replace the current 'About' dialog with a Settings page consistent with other Microsoft applications and add app theme option as initial setting.

### Goals
* Replace current about dialog with settings page
* Be consistent with settings UX patterns established in other Microsoft apps
* Add basic theme selection option common across many other apps

### Non-Goals
* Add any additional options at this time.

### Feature Requirements
* Users can navigate to a new Settings page that takes up the full view.
* Users can set the current app theme.
* Users can review information about the app (e.g., version number, terms, etc.)
